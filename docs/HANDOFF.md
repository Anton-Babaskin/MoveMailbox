# Engineering handoff — 2026-09-10

## Where to continue

- Repository: `Anton-Babaskin/MoveMailbox` (GitHub is canonical).
- Baseline: `main` at `5315ce2`, merged PR #8. Its CI run `34399888643` passed.
- Current task branch: `feature/live-imap-storage-recovery`, based on that main.
  [PR #9](https://github.com/Anton-Babaskin/MoveMailbox/pull/9). Verify its current
  state and CI by branch, not by the old merged PR #8.
- Follow root `AGENTS.md` and [two-computer workflow](TWO-COMPUTERS.md). Fetch all
  branches first; do not reset another computer's local work or merge all refs.

## Completed in this task

1. Finished the previous stage's handoff: confirmed PR #8 merged and main CI
   green, then started this branch from the updated main.
2. Added portable Codex instructions, safe start/end Git synchronization rules
   and this progress record. No global settings or automatic background sync.
3. Extended the bounded ENOSPC harness with an explicitly authorized real-IMAP
   mode. The test wrapper pauses **after native imapsync success, before worker
   finalization**; it never modifies native arguments or production code.
4. Real copy + ENOSPC without restart passed: no false success; terminal failure
   persisted after capacity returned, attempts=1, credential envelope removed.
5. Real copy + ENOSPC + SIGKILL passed: same database retained by a holder,
   opted-in ordinary recovery completed in attempts=2 after lease expiry.
6. Both runs: SHA-256, flags, INTERNALDATE and message count matched; subsequent
   transfers copied zero messages; source unchanged, guest isolation and empty
   terminal envelopes verified, no mailbox passwords in service logs.
7. Added an operator-safe `age` metadata backup utility with atomic object commit,
   manifest/checksum validation, traversal/link/size limits and no-overwrite
   restore. It never includes worker private keys or mailbox contents.
8. Added 26 offline tests and a Docker backup drill. Demo encrypted backup,
   interrupted/corrupt/truncated object rejection, fresh-volume restore and a
   post-restore migration all pass. Rotation guard and coordinated key/token
   rotation pass in the Docker remote-worker drill.

Evidence, sanitized job IDs and reproduction: [PILOT.md](PILOT.md), September 10
section. All temporary lab containers were stopped. Test mail and ordinary lab
volumes were retained; the bounded worker tmpfs disappears after its last mount.
The test gate bind mount was temporary; recreate these labs with the harness,
do not just restart their stopped containers.

## Verification and honest limits

- Local Windows Go 1.27: `go test ./...` and `go vet ./...` passed.
- WSL Python: 26 offline harness tests passed, including age round-trip, archive
  commit, corruption, path-safety, rotation-gate and ENOSPC tests.
- Both new live-mail modes passed with native imapsync and verified IMAP TLS,
  guest API and encrypted remote-worker queue, not the demo engine.
- CI is authoritative for the exact pushed SHA: inspect the current branch PR
  checks for Linux race/vet/vulnerability tests, builds and Docker regression
  matrix. Do not infer a new head is green from the baseline run above.
- This is disk exhaustion at **post-copy finalization**, not ENOSPC injected
  during the APPEND literal. Exact APPEND disconnect/lost-ACK tests are separate
  previous proofs. Neither result establishes universal exactly-once delivery.
- Live strict mirror was not rerun here; destructive replay remains forbidden
  and is covered by the earlier demo crash matrix. No production policy changed.
- No VPS, production KMS, off-site provider or public launch is implied.
- The encrypted backup drill uses a local directory as an object-store model; it
  is not evidence of an actual S3/B2/Wasabi off-site upload or provider ACL.

## Next two proposed technical steps

1. Run the same backup/restore against a user-provided encrypted off-site bucket
   on the VPS, with object lock/versioning and independent checksum retrieval.
2. Add paid-account/magic-link entitlements and a production deployment gate
   only after VPS egress firewall, HTTPS, retention and incident contacts are
   configured. Keep free guest migration without registration.

MVP release gates still include deployment egress/SSRF enforcement, external
provider coverage, load/abuse tests, ownership of retention/alerts, HTTPS and
production secrets. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## Files deliberately not synchronized

This machine has unrelated site ZIP/tar exports, a local log, a Replit prompt
and an untracked nested `website/` repository. They were preserved, not staged
or deleted. Site-source synchronization needs its own explicit repository scope.
Mailbox credentials and generated service keys are never part of the handoff.
